# Math resources for blind people

Math is hard. Braille math with formal education is very hard. Braille math without any formal education is a nightmare. Here are some resources that I have discovered in my math(s) journey. I hope they help you suffer a little less than I did.

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-pro{ject.org/)
  - This is markup for writing technical documents and the like. Complex and not suitable for taking notes, but it can be handy for generating pretty math content for sighted people or generating MathML content for embedding in a website.
- [MathPlayer](https://docs.wiris.com/mathplayer/en/mathplayer-and-mathml-technology.html)
  - If a website is using MathML, this makes it easier for your screen reader to read it correctly.
- [MathType](https://www.wiris.com/en/mathtype/)
  - You can use this to create and edit math. I never had much luck with it, but you might get a better handle than me.
  - this option allegedly works in MS Word.
- [Orion TI-84 Plus talking graphing calculator](https://www.orbitresearch.com/product/orion-ti-84-plus/)
  - I have this and absolutely love it. It can even output UEB or Nemeth to a Braille display over USB.
- [Desmos online graphing calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
  - This is an online graphing calculator that some blind people swear by. It won't be allowed on a test, but it's basically a calculator anywhere as long as you have internet.
- [Wikki sticks](https://www.wikkistix.com/)
  - I use these in conjunction with tactile graph paper to graph stuff. Low residue, but keep some alcohol wipes handy if using alongside a Braille display. You can also have fun with them and build stuff with very low mess.
- [Python Math object reference](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_math.asp)
  - I used this to shorten the equations I typed out in a text editor such as Notepad++ or VScode (do not use a word processor like MS Word unless you want even more pain). I did not use full syntax, just the functions themselves (e.g. I don't add the "Math." bit). The goal of using a truncated python syntax is to create something that balances readability and speed. It doesn't need to be readable by the interpreter. This got me through my remedial algebra course.
  - since you are typing math with the characters on your keyboard and not using algebraic notation, your equations will be 1D. This means you will write an entire formula out on a single line, rather than being able to organize different parts of it spatially like with pencil and paper.
  - You will need to use a lot more parentheses than you expect to maintain good readability on long formulas or anything that involves exponents, roots, logs, complexes, etc.
- [Orbit multiline displays](https://www.orbitresearch.com/product/orbit-slate-520-multi-line-refreshable-braille-display/)
  - Whatever you gotta do, get your counselor to buy one of these for you. Multiple lines is a game-changer for math and coding. There are two versions, I think.
- [Swell paper](https://americanthermoform.com/product/swell-touch-paper/)
  - This is intended to be used with specialized equipment that your college /should/ have. They should also have someone dedicated to creating tactile content to be printed onto this stuff.
- [Create your own SVG's with no vision](https://blindsvg.com/)
  - This was written by a blind guy. It's really cool and worth your time even if you are sighted.

That's all I've got for now. Feel free to submit a PR if there's something you think is worth adding.
